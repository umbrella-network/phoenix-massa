# Massa support for Umbrella oracle

The goal of this repo is to add Massa support to the Umbrella oracle by translating their solidity smart contracts to Massa.

## General structure

We need to translate SCs from this repo: https://github.com/umbrella-network/phoenix/tree/develop/contracts

The way it works:
* `/interfaces` => solidity interfaces for the things below
* `registry.sol` (needs to be translated) => registry allowing to query the latest addresses of the other Umbrella SCs to allow smart contracts to be upgraded
  * dependency: `extensions/registrable.sol` for   `atomicupdate`
* `onchainFeeds/umbrellafeeds.sol` (to be translated) => main contract providing the latest data to callers and allowing data updates by a list of allowed signing validators (note that `UmbrellaFeedsReader.sol` and `UmbrellaFeedsReaderFactory.sol` do not need to be translated)
  * the cryptography used is the native ETH signature verification (we have an ABI for that)
  * interacts with `/stakingBankStatic` => hardcoded list of validators allowed to sign data updates
* `/Stakingbankstatic/stakingbankstatic.sol` (to be translated) = abstract contract base (implements the interface) for the static list of allowed data providers
* `/Stakingbankstatic/stakingbankstaticProd.sol` (to be translated) = hardcoded list of production validators

On our side we also need to provide Umbrella with the SDK to integrate Massa (operation signing, event and data read-out)
